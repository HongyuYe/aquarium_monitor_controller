# aquarium_moniter_controller
This project relates to Internet of Things, it was developed with Microsoft Visual Studio, Azure and Android Studio using C#, .Net, Java, Javascript, and HTML. It has an Android app and a website with the same features. They can automatically or manually monitor and control the temperature and lighting of the Aquarium, using fan, LED lights and Raspberry Pi which is a very tiny computer board, it is connected with a sensor.  The user needs to set the desired temperature values and if the real-time temperature exceed the threshold the fans will turn on themselves. In the LED Lights case, the client needs to set the time for the LED Lights to turn on and turn off. The user can also receive temperature alerts from the app and emails.
The project was for aquariums in tropical Queensland, so I only applied cooling system, no heating system.
In this project I also built a Web API for data communications between the web page, Android app, the cloud, the Raspberry Pi and the smart switch for the cooling system and LED lights.
