# aquarium_moniter_controller
This project relates to Internet of Things, it was developed with Microsoft Visual Studio, Azure and Android Studio using C#, .Net, Java, Javascript, and HTML. It comes with an Android app and a website provide the user with the same features. 1.Monitor the temperature of the Aquarium. Using Raspberry Pi which is a very tiny computer board, it is connected with a sensor that an Android app and website can connect through Internet and monitor/control the aquariums temperature and current status of the fan and LED light 2.The user will be able to operate Manually or Automatically. 3.Manual control of the Fans, LED lights can be done through the app and website 4.Auto control to the fans and LED Lights where the user needs to provide the desired temperature values and if the temperature exceeds the threshold set temperature value the fans will turn on themselves. In LED Lights case, the client needs to set the time for the LED Lights to turn on and turn off. 5. The user can receive alerts and notifications from the app and emails.
The project was for aquariums in tropical Queensland, so I only applied cooling system, no heating system.
In this project I also built a Web API for data communications between the web page, Android app, the cloud, the Raspberry Pi and the smart switch for the cooling system.
